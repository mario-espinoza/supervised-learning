Today I read an article about a woman with chronic migraines who ended up getting a diath pieecing  and she claimed that now that she has the earring her headaches are completely relieved. That sounded crazy to me  so I did so me research. Apparently the piercing causes an acupuncture like pressure on a nerve near your head that helps increase the blood flow  making headaches less frequent or less painfull. I have been suffering from chronic migraines for a very long time  and the medications I have been given won t help at all and I m sick of trying new prescriptions. I would like to know if anyone who has a daith piercing has experienced less migraines/headaches  should I get this piercing  if I do would I get it on both ears or would it just be a waste of money?,Particulares20151106045916AAQKkvu,Weekly Salary Œ£6.15 per hour up to 16 hours per week?

I tried to ask out the girl that i like today. We both go to the same college and (I think) we've been hitting it off well the past few weeks. The problem is that i always feel like she is getting the idea that i just want to be friends (since i haven't made any moves). So she's been telling me how much she wants to go to a festival that's going on in the city and i took that opportunity to ask her out. She said that she really wanted to go on a certain day and i said that i can get tickets and that we could go together. That's when things went wrong. She took that and turned it around on me  saying that i shouldn't go around offering stuff like that to people  and if i do I'll be used and thrown away. This really took me aback  so i just tried to just recover ground. i cant remember what i said  but i ended up walking her to her dorm and leaving. In the end she didn't seem to realize that i asked her out and i really don't know where i went wrong. I'm a nice guy by nature and I didn't want to be aggressive about it so that may have been the issue but i don't want to come off as pushy. I just would like to know if there's a better way to ask her out.,Opiniones20151025141251AAN5LEV,Ramadan  do you believe Russia is helping to wipe out isis?  ,Opiniones20151025161436AAG1XBJ,Fun 1 player games that aren't video game?

High on a hill  where the wind whistles low  and whispers sweet secrets to flowers below; Where neon green grasses ripple like waves  bowing and swaying at the foot of dark caves. A tremendous tree grows here and towers  over the land bespeckled with flowers; It branches reach for diamond white skies  watching the world with emerald eyes. Beneath this grand tree  writers in silence  write with a quiet  desperate  defiance; Onward they write  on sepia pages  For centuries now  throughout all the ages. They write of the songs  that yet are unsung  They write of the tales  for the old and the young; They write of their thoughts  in mystical verse  They write prose concisely  lucid and terse. Each writer sits quiet  then pauses to think  of words that dance blithely in invisible ink; Tho' quiet  each writer is never forlorn  because when you're writing  you can't be alone! You can be all you want  you get to choose  No one dare berate  insult and abuse! Each writer is smiling  laughing within  for each story that ends  one more must begin!

I'm a big One Direction fan and I know what's going on. They said they're not splitting up at least 50 times  both at concerts and on Twitter. They said they love what they're doing and are coming back after their break. They're taking a short break starting in MARCH next year. It hasn't even started. They just won't have a tour or new album next year. They even said part of the reason they're taking a break is to work on music and Louis and Liam are going to work together on making better music. They even said there's going to be a 2017 tour. So many bands and celebrities take breaks as long as 3 years and no one thinks they're splitting up. 1D did tours 4 years and a row and 5 albums in a row  they said they barely ever see their family. The break has nothing to do with them splitting up. Just recently  they said the four of them love what they're doing and want to continue. Everywhere I go  everyone says they already split up. Why? I don't get it? Obviously to confirm  they have NOT split up and they're not planning on it. Only the proper fans know that. Their new album hasn't even come out yet!! They have like 10 shows to do for promo! How would they be doing that if they're not together?

I have been thinking of going Vegetarian or Vegan for a while now. For reasons of Health  Environmental and Animal Cruelty. I have some concerns that I would love some answers to. I don t mind myself going vegetarian or vegan but I don t necessarily want to put others out - by way of making them have vegan meals for me or refusing to eat meals prepared with animal products or me preparing meals for them that are entirely vegan. This is just one example that comes to mind: If I went to a friends/families who had a BBQ - the meat has already been purchased and may just go to waste if it doesn t all get eaten. would there be any harm in eating meat/animal products only when its already been prepared. And i don t mean something like me going out to eat meat such as going to a restaurant and ordering a steak. Is there any point going vegan/vegetarian most of the time but on the off occasion eating meat etc such as on Christmas day or something along those lines or if once in a blue moon I felt like eating something bad. I just feel so lost  like what is the point when it will be so hard and ill be critisied by everyone I know - when I don t eat a lot of meat anyway.

Im a 17 year old female and for the past three months I have had headaches every single day. At first when I told my mum she thought nothing of it and assumed it was just due to the weather and told me to take tablets for it so I took painkillers near enough every day and they had no effect. Up until a week ago when the headaches started to feel slightly worse and I began to get an earache which I still have I went to the doctor and they told me I'm having tension headaches and he prescribed me more medication. He asked me did I get the headaches in school which I do and he believes it is all down to anxiety and stress  the front of my head from the temple backwords to above my ear is so sore. I can barely turn my head that direction or it is sore. I feel nauseous every day and have done for 4 months due to having pains in my side once a month that they also think is due to this but i believe it may be ovarian cancer. My eyes also feel slightly strained at times as they are slightly sore at times I do wear glasses but I am so afraid I am going to die because I constantly everyday have some sort of ache or pain and I'm so terrified that I am going to become more information on a graph or just become a number my main fear of cancer is due to the fact it runs in my family but it has been mostly males that have been diagnosed other than the only female which was my auntie who sadly passed away from it this year.

My boyfriend and I have been going out for a while and he really wants to have sex. I have been wanting to wait only for the fact that I don't feel comfortable naked. I told him to wait until I lost some weight and I did but my skin sagged really badly which I felt looked even worse than me just being fat. I got depressed over it and gained most of the weight back. He still really wants to have sex and I would too if I didn't feel like I looked so gross. I can't afford and am not old enough to get surgery to remove excess skin so it's really just choosing the lesser of two evils at this point  fat or loose skin. I don't want him to start getting fed up that I keep telling him no and to wait because I feel like I've already had him waiting for a long time. I figured if I left a long shirt or even a dress than maybe I wouldn't feel so insecure about it. I was thinking of wearing something strapless so he could pull it down a bit but it would still cover my stomach and what not. Obviously he knows I'm fat  clothes can only hide so much  but I think he will be grossed out to see my body or that he won't be able to stay turned on once he sees me. The only issue is it would be his first time and mine so I don't know what he's expecting. Would it be strange for me to ask him to leave my clothes on?

From NOAA While a winter comparable to 2013/14 would have been roughly a once-a-decade event in 1881 (return periods from 5äóñ20 years)  it has become roughly a once-in-a-thousand years event in 2014 (return periods from 90 to over 10 000 years). is implies that extremely cold winters are two orders of magnitude less frequent in todayäó»s climate than in that of around 1881. Using a Gaussian t rather than GPD  the change in probability for such a cold winter would go from once-in-14 years in 1881 to once-in-200 years in 2014 (Supplemental Fig. S3.6). Due to the area-averaging  these changes in odds are more extreme than those found by van Oldenborgh et al. (2015) for individual stations since 1951  but match the drastic reduction in odds that Christidis et al. (2014) computed for cold springs in the United Kingdom. äó_,Complejas20151108144814AAgH3ZX,"It has been said  that atmospheric pressure does not affect temperature Global warming of Venus?

No such place exists  but if it did äóñ it would be extremely hot  like Venus. A back of the envelope estimate äóñ temperatures on earth increase by about 80C going from 20 to 100 kPa  so at 9 000 kPa we would expect temperatures to be in the ballpark of : 20C + ln(9000/(100-20)) *80C = 400C Continued This is very close to what we see on Venus. The high temperatures there can be almost completely explained by atmospheric pressure äóñ not composition. If 90% of the CO2 in Venus atmosphere was replaced by Nitrogen  it would change temperatures there by only a few tens of degrees.

My other rat who I got as a baby and have now had for about three months is the one I m more worried about. I take him out all the time since he rarely sleeps and is very energetic. He s comfortable around my entire family  so I m worried he might become more attached to my sister than me. They ve both met and been handled by my sister so they already know her. I ve already told my sister how to take care of them. Check their water  what to feed them give them their nightly smoothies  all that stuff. I also told her not to handle them  only to let them out to run around together and maybe hold or pet them occasionally  just in case they might become attached to her :/ I also am going to sleep with a small blanket a few nights before I go and then put it in their cage so they have my scent. Also  skyping them so they can hear my voice. They re like my children okay! So what do you think? Do you think they ll forget me or not? I know they re very smart  I m just worried. Not to mention my oldest one has very bad separation anxiety even if I just leave the room.,Archivada20151102232153AAhU3Tv,My kitten licked some flea meds off of his brother and now he is throwing up and disoriented.

I am renting an apartment  and my lease is up at the end of March. I recently put an offer on a house  and my realtor is telling me that there is a chance I could be getting the keys before Christmas - if all goes well. I spoke with one of the ladies in the office and asked about terminating the lease before March. She let me know that I would have to pay 2 month rent  and possibly lose my security deposit (which was one months rent).
