            If I ran for president and won could I act really stupid and manage to not get impeached?
        ";" I'm talking about the greatest joke of all time. If I was to study law for 8 years and become determined to be the greatest politician of all time for the sake of my joke. Would I get impeached if I won the election and just did really stupid things once I was in office? like REALLY stupid.

Here's an example I would demand that all humans were to be removed from the White House and I would live with monkeys and replace all rooms with indoor gardens with banana trees and I would poop in my hands and throw it at people.

Another example of stupid **** I would do is this; every time I was supposed to give a speech I would just start making monkey noises and throw my poop at the reporters.

Would this be worth it even if I did get impeached? or would the corrupt government stop my plans as soon as I demanded humans to be removed from the White House?

            Can you convert an internal combustion auto engine to a hybrid for more power?
        ";" Considering the engine power options of the Focus RS is limited to an inline 4 -(which I will admit 350 hp is not bad)---it would seem that since you can only get so much power out of an inline 2.3 liter 4 cylinder that the next step would be to add a hybrid motor, like the motors that ""super-cars"" use for an initial launch.  It would seem that with an electric motor one could counter the turbo-lag associated with high performance set-ups and/or enhance the maximum power output of a car.";" Cars & Transportation";"Particulares";"0";"0";"8";"0"

shes only in 4th grade.

They don't teach children to do the ChaCha slide, humpty dance, running man, robocop, cabbage patch, and all that cool stuff from back in the day? (I'm 43 by the way)....this is just sad. I've also heard their teaching them this ""hit the quan"" dance next. Next thing is twerking like miley cyrus and all this justin bieber swag crap. I didnt know these dancss until I googled them and I'm so dissapointed in this generation's education system.

So she's been telling me how much she wants to go to a festival that's going on in the city and i took that opportunity to ask her out.  She said that she really wanted to go on a certain day and i said that i can get tickets and that we could go together.  That's when things went wrong.  She took that and turned it around on me, saying that i shouldn't go around offering stuff like that to people, and if i do I'll be used and thrown away.  This really took me aback, so i just tried to just recover ground. i cant remember what i said, but i ended up walking her to her dorm and leaving.  In the end she didn't seem to realize that i asked her out and i really don't know where i went wrong.

            Would you please cc this poem about a tree?
        ";" High on a hill, where the wind whistles low,
and whispers sweet secrets to flowers below;
Where neon green grasses ripple like waves,
bowing and swaying at the foot of dark caves.

A tremendous tree grows here and towers,
over the land bespeckled with flowers;
It branches reach for diamond white skies,
watching the world with emerald eyes.

Beneath this grand tree, writers in silence,
write with a quiet, desperate, defiance;
Onward they write, on sepia pages,
For centuries now, throughout all the ages.

They write of the songs, that yet are unsung,
They write of the tales, for the old and the young;
They write of their thoughts, in mystical verse,
They write prose concisely, lucid and terse.

Each writer sits quiet, then pauses to think,
of words that dance blithely in invisible ink;
Tho' quiet, each writer is never forlorn,
because when you're writing, you can't be alone!

You can be all you want, you get to choose,
No one dare berate, insult and abuse!
Each writer is smiling, laughing within,
for each story that ends, one more must begin!

It is here that you can be safe, strong and free,
for this tree, gentle friend, is God's poetry...";" Arts & Humanities";"Opiniones";"0";"0";"4";"0"

            How to turn on radiator?
        ";" I recently moved into an apartment building and I'm completely clueless on how to use a radiator. There doesn't seem to be a thermostat anywhere I haven't been able to figure out how to turn my radiator on. I'm sure my landlord would be the best person to ask about this, but he hasn't yet returned my calls and its COLD here so I'm hoping there's something I can do myself.

For some reason Yahoo isn't allowing me to add pictures, but there is a little silver knob at the top left of the radiator. Last month when I tried to test it out, I turned the knob and nothing happened. Now water comes out when I turn the knob, but nothing heats up. Any suggestions?
I tried opening the valve, how long does it need to be open for? Do you just put a bucket under the valve for the water while its open? Or does the water stop coming at any point..?

            Does the African Humid Period hold the key as to why we have NATURAL, abrupt Climate Shifts that affect the entire World?
        ";" "" ... The African Humid Period occurred between 14,800 and 5,500 years ago, and was the last occurrence of a ""green Sahara"". Conditions in the Sahara during the African Humid Period were dominated by a strong North African Monsoon, resulting in larger annual rainfall totals compared to today’s conditions. With the increased rainfall, the vegetation patterns North Africa were nothing like what we see today. The majority of the Sahara region for instance was characterized by expansive grasslands, also known steppe. Meanwhile, the Sahel region south of the Sahara was mostly savanna. Today the Sahara region is mostly desert and the Sahel is characterized by steppe conditions. The African Humid Period was also characterized by a network of vast waterways in the Sahara, consisting of large lakes, rivers, and deltas. The four largest lakes were Lake Megachad, Lake Megafezzan, Ahnet-Mouydir Megalake, and Chotts Megalake. Large rivers in the region included the Senegal River, Nile River, Sahabi River, and Kufra River. These river and lake systems provided corridors that allowed many animal species, including humans, to expand their range across the Sahara. ... ""

Here's what recently happened during the Little Ice Age also :

"" ... cooling events during the Little Ice Age Period are detected in sediments accumulating off Africa, but the cooling events appear to be larger, ranging between 3–8 °C. ... ""
 Here's my link for those who demand one for verifying : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Afri...

Additionally from my link :

"" ... Geologic evidence from the beginning and end of the African Humid Period suggests that both the onset and termination of the African Humid Period were abrupt. In fact both events likely occurred on a timescale of decades to centuries. ... ""
 There have been 5 ""warming periods"" since the last REAL Ice Age 12,000 years ago. The African Humid Period accounts for 2 of these warm periods. These 2 warming periods were very abrupt just as the current warming period has been.  We are currently in the 5th warming period. This warming period equals the previous 4.

        ";" Yesterday at about 2-3PM I had protected sex with my boyfriend. I am 16, he is 17. We used a condom and during intercourse I don't think it split, it was also my first time.

However, when he came, he came all over my stomach, and it was a lot. When we were finished, I sat up and a bit of semen trickled down to my vagina, but it only went onto the top of my clitoris.

I wiped it off as soon as possible with baby wipes. I don't think any semen got near the entrance of my vagjna, but I think some may have gotten onto my labia.

Do you think there is a possibility that I could be pregnant? I'm freaking out and don't know what I should do.

There is no way that I can have a child at this time.

I was thinking about going to my local pharmacy and collecting a morning after pill, is this a good idea? And can I get it for free?

Also, my period is due in 3 days and I am really hoping it comes, however my best friend told me that if I keep worrying about being pregnant, it could delay my pregnancy.

does BBC think we are all infidels ?
OK church isn't the best place to connect to God but how can God be left when we are supposed to be a Christian country and the statistics are desperately sad -  all possible solutions should be looked into";" News & Events";"Opiniones";"0";"0";"7";"0"

            Why are most parents so against gaming?
        ";" It just seems like whenever their child wants to play computer/video games, most parents are really against it and try to put blocks on their computer to block them from playing games. Not just violent/adult games, even if the game is non-violent and appropriate for the age of the parent's child, they seem to be against practically all games. Not necessarily people who are ADDICTED, even people who only play a bit.

            Is Science a human construct or a body of immutable laws of God and read by human intelligence?
        ";"
 Best to condense the question to posit the question as if Science and its immutable laws exist even without humanity.Mans methodology happens  to observe such laws whether  scientific  moral and arguably  spiritual as well is it not? Therefore,""Are laws of science immutable whether with or without human commentary?""";" Science & Mathematics";"Archivada";"0";"0";"17";"0"
